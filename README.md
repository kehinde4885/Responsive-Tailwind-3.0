# Responsive-Tailwind-3.0
First Multiple page tailwind project, its proving to be relatively easier than i thought.
As intuited, the tailwind components make creating multiple pages very fast.
I can only imagine how fast this would be with REACT.JS also implemented. We shall see

Notes:
I got a little bit of insight into tailwind layers, its used to specify styles to be 
Overwritten.
Base Styles < Component Styles < Utility Styles

For Responsive Design, Build Wrappers and Elements according to the biggest Screen Size,
but style it with mobile-first approach(Works)

Always Remember to Implement font Size inheritance between parent and Children for 
Relativity and Ease of Responsiveness
**Look into Modifying the Tailwind theme to Enable this in the next project.
